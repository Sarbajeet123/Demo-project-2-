    <h1>About AI</h1>
    "Artificial Intelligence is a new technology in the field of computer science. “Artificial” means man-made that is not natural and “Intelligence” refers to the ability to think and make decisions. Therefore, we can say that making machines like computers to take their own decisions is Artificial Intelligence. This could be possible using various computer programming and codes.

In other words, Artificial Intelligence or AI is a field that makes computers to behave like humans and make decisions on their own. Machine learning and natural language processing are all part of Artificial Intelligence. Some advanced hardware and software along with the high-level programming languages are used in AI applications.

Paragraph 2 – 120 Words
Artificial Intelligence is the wide branch of computer science. It deals with developing smart machines that can operate without human interaction. Today we can think of a machine that can work according to our needs without providing instructions.

Artificial Intelligence can be used in video games, mobile phones, cars, surveillance, etc.

Many famous social platforms like Google, Facebook and many more use Artificial Intelligence. The recommendation in Google or any other site uses AI. Google assistance and Siri in iPhone is a virtual assistance program which is an example of Artificial Intelligence.

Another famous example of Artificial Intelligence is Amazon’s Alexa and Amazon Echo developed by Amazon. We have heard of self-controlling cars. They do work on the principle of Artificial Intelligence.


Paragraph 3 – 150 Words
The concept of Artificial Intelligence was introduced back in 1950. Alan Turing, a mathematician and computer scientist designed a machine named as “Turing Machine”. This machine can test whether the computers can make decisions or not. The test can check the ability of machines to respond like humans.

The year 1956 is considered as the birth of Artificial Intelligence. John McCarthy, a computer scientist has introduced the word “Artificial Intelligence” in the world of computer science.

In 1966, the first chatbot by the name “Eliza” (Natural Language Processing computer program) was developed by Joseph Weizenbaum. In 1972, Japan developed the first humanoid robot by the name “WABOT-1” (WAseda roBOT).

In 1997, IBM Deep Blue, a chess playing computer program, gained attention by defeating Gary Kasparov, world chess champion.

Thereafter, many social sites started using AI. Now we can see the vast applications of Artificial Intelligence in our daily life.
